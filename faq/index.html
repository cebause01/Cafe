                        <div class="faq-answer-content">
                            We source our coffee beans from premium regions around the world, including Ethiopia, Colombia, Guatemala, and Indonesia. We work directly with farmers and cooperatives to ensure quality and ethical sourcing practices.

                        <div class="faq-answer-content">
                            Store your coffee beans in an airtight container in a cool, dark place away from heat, moisture, and light. Avoid storing in the refrigerator or freezer as this can introduce moisture. For best flavor, use within 2-3 weeks of opening.

                        <div class="faq-answer-content">
                            Light roasts preserve more of the bean's original flavor with brighter, fruity notes. Medium roasts offer balanced flavor with hints of chocolate and caramel. Dark roasts have bold, intense flavors with smoky notes and lower acidity. Choose based on your taste preference!
